# The Oxford Oath

The current version is available here: <https://github.com/lyndondrake/oxford-oath/>

The development of the Oxford Oath for Artificial Intelligence began in early 2024, and since October 2024 has been part of a project (the Oxford Collaboration on Theology and Artificial Intelligence, OCTAI) funded by a donation from the John Templeton Foundation. The OCTAI project is hosted by the Ian Ramsey Centre for Science and Religion, part of the Faculty of Theology and Religion at the University of Oxford.

An oath is different from a code of practice or a set of standards. It identifies an ethos, on which other ethical layers such as the ethical commitments found in a code of practice, or the ethical standards found in formalised standards, can be layered.

The ethos found in an oath identifes certain ethical focal points, which orient and inform moral reasoning. An oath ideally has a degree of flexibility that means it is not tied to a single moment in technological history, and can be used by people from a range of religious traditions as well as secular people. It does not free people from undertaking moral reasoning themselves; it helps them to undertake that moral reasoning as free people.
