# The Oxford Oath

The current version is available here: <https://github.com/lyndondrake/oxford-oath/>

The development of the Oxford Oath for Artificial Intelligence began in early 2024, and since October 2024 has been part of a project (the Oxford Collaboration on Theology and Artificial Intelligence, OCTAI) funded by a donation from the John Templeton Foundation. The OCTAI project is hosted by the Ian Ramsey Centre for Science and Religion, part of the Faculty of Theology and Religion at the University of Oxford.

An oath is different from a code of practice or a set of standards. An oath frees practitioners from having to revisit first principles in every case: it intends to narrow choice wisely, providing stability for moral reasoning and choice of action. Its constraints are intended to be liberating.

An oath identifies certain ethical focal points, which orient and inform moral reasoning. An oath ideally has a degree of flexibility that means it is not tied to a single moment in technological history, and can be used by people from a range of religious traditions as well as secular people. It does not free people from undertaking moral reasoning themselves; it helps them to undertake that moral reasoning as free people.

In order to serve AI practitioners well, we now have an Open Letter and an Oath. The Open Letter is more descriptive and is intended to function for a wide audience who will be able to sign up to it. It also functions as a preamble for the Oath itself, which we expect will be professed by a subset of those willing to sign up to the Open Letter.
