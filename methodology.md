# Methodology

A more detailed methodology will be published in due course. In brief, this oath was built by bringing together a number of subject experts, and by convening several workshops for consultation with a range of people in AI technology and science, public policy, theology, ethics, and other related fields. We worked to ensure that diverse voices from across the world, and voices of those involved in basic-level AI work (as well as company founders) were heard.

We used LLMs at various stages to provide draft summaries of existing work, and for the Oath itself, to take the human-written summaries of the workshop progress and propose initial phrases, some of which have been retained in the oath.
