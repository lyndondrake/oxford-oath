# Terminology

The terminology in the oath is flexible, and concise. For some of the terms, we have offered a brief explanation. In due course, we will provide an annotated version of the oath with commentary interleaved for each clause.

## Worthy objects of attention

Related to motivation is attention, and the human ability for our attention to be captured by appealing to our lower-level desires. At one level this is not only acceptable but in fact good: hunger is a basic desire, and is worthy of paying attention to. At another, we can find technological systems distracting us from higher-level motivations because of their facility at capturing our attention. At their best, AI could help us keep give our attention in ways which correspond with what we think is most worthwhile.
