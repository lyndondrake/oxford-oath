# Terminology

## We or I

The preamble is collective because it expresses shared beliefs, using plural pronouns. A person professing an oath does so as an act of individual volition (which joins them to others), so the commitments themselves using singular pronouns.

## Motivations

Motivations are the needs and desires which drive our actions, and there are both primary drives such as hunger and thirst and secondary drives towards higher-level goals such as praise, money, and so forth. People conceive of certain higher-level motivations as having a nobility. For example, the willingness to defer action which would sate one's own hunger in order to care for a child's needs can be seen as a noble motivation.

## Degradation of the dignity of work

This has occurred, for example in the work required to tag offensive content, and the replacement of humans for work they love (e.g. creative work).

## Peace

In Christian theology, peace is an end that encompasses a holistic view of the wellbeing of people, communities, and the world. Most Christian theologians recognise the necessity of the exercise of force and even violence to oppose evil, and so the use of force can be a means achieving peace. The point of the reference is to maintain a differentiation between means and ends.
