# Terminology

The terminology in the oath is flexible, and concise. For some of the terms, we have offered a brief explanation. In due course, we will provide an annotated version of the oath with commentary interleaved for each clause.

## We or I

The preamble is collective because it expresses shared beliefs, using plural pronouns. A person professing an oath does so as an act of individual volition (which joins them to others), so the commitments themselves using singular pronouns.

## Virtuous motivations

Motivations are the needs and desires which drive our actions, and there are both primary drives such as hunger and thirst and secondary drives towards higher-level goals such as praise, money, and so forth. People conceive of certain higher-level motivations as having a nobility. For example, the willingness to defer action which would sate one's own hunger in order to care for a child's needs can be seen as a noble motivation. Virtuous motivations in the oath distinguishes these motivations from more base desires.

## Worthy objects of attention

Related to motivation is attention, and the human ability for our attention to be captured by appealing to our lower-level desires. At one level this is not only acceptable but in fact good: hunger is a basic desire, and is worthy of paying attention to. At another, we can find technological systems distracting us from higher-level motivations because of their facility at capturing our attention. At their best, AI could help us keep give our attention in ways which correspond with what we think is most worthwhile.

## Degradation of the dignity of work

This has occurred, for example in the work required to tag offensive content, and the replacement of humans for work they love (e.g. creative work).

## Instrument of peace

Peace is an end that encompasses a holistic view of the wellbeing of people, communities, and the world. Most philosophers and theologians recognise the necessity of the exercise of force and even violence to oppose evil, and so the use of force can be a means achieving peace. The point of the reference is to maintain a differentiation between means and ends.

A pacifist will of course be able to profess this phrase in the oath, but we also intended it to be a way for those who are not pacifists to give voice to a separation of good ends (peace) from violent means (waging war), and to frame their activity in defence and other war-related work for serving a good end, while ruling out implicating one's work in violence for violence's sake.
