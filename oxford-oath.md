## Preamble

Believing in the sanctity of every human person, and that technology ought to serve us and contribute to the common good;

Conscious that our creativity is both a gift and a responsibility, and that the tools we form in turn form us;

Recognising that AI work requires the exercise of judgement for choices made with limited information and agency;

Lamenting the ways AI has already been used to erode attention, displace human connection, degrade the dignity of work, and inflict harm upon the natural world;

And yet, rejoicing in the potential of AI to aid understanding, improve wellbeing, democratise opportunity, and empower humanity in our shared vocation to seek the true, the good, and the beautiful;

## Commitments

In the presence of God (or: what I hold most sacred) and these witnesses, I make these commitments:

### Orientation of faith

I will approach my work with humility, mindful of my limitations and the consequences of my work.

I will honour the sanctity of humanity, neither attributing personhood to my work, nor elevating my work to divine status.

I will be identify and resist the temptations to dominate in a quest for efficiency and power.

I will approach my work with joy and caution at the wonder and weight of what we are making.

### Vision of hope for humans

I will design, implement, and use systems that empower human governance.

I will align my work with noble human motivations and noble objects of attention.

I will develop my work to support the social fabric of humanity and the wellbeing of the natural world.

I will not design, deploy, or use systems that degrade, dehumanise, or disorient.

### Responsibility for outcomes

I will embed honesty in my work about the nature, imperfections, and limits of AI systems.

I will guard against illusions that erode the understanding of reality.

I will strive to ensure that my work offers protection for the vulnerable.

I will guard against reinforcing or creating harmful asymmetries of power.

I will strive to make my work an instrument of peace.

I will guard against the use of my work to devalue good forms of human work.

I will cultivate an awareness of the complex connections between technical decisions and human consequences.

## Conclusion

I will uphold the integrity of this oath, and when faced with a conflict between these commitments and the demands of my profession, I will give voice to my conscience.

(Optional: May God who has given me the will to profess these commitments grant me also the grace to perform them.)
