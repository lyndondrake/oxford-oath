Believing that every human person has dignity and unique worth, and that technology ought to serve humans not become an end in itself;

Conscious that our creativity is both a gift and a responsibility, and that the tools we form in turn form us;

Lamenting the ways AI has already been used to erode attention, displace human connection, degrade the dignity of work, and inflict harm upon the natural world;

And yet, rejoicing in the potential of AI to reveal truth, restore health, democratise opportunity, and empower humanity in our shared vocation to seek the true, the good, and the beautiful;

I make these commitments:

I will approach my work with humility, mindful of my limitations and the consequences of my work.

I will continually consider motivations, with the common good in mind.

I will honour the distinct beauty of humanity, neither attributing personhood to my work, nor elevating my work to divine status.

I will be attentive to the temptations to dominate in a quest for efficiency and power.

I will approach my work with joy and caution at the wonder and weight of what we are making.

I will seek to align my work with the good of human persons, their communities, and the world.

I will remain conscious of the asymmetries of power these technologies reinforce or create.

I will embed honesty in my work about the nature, imperfections, and limits of AI systems.

I will uphold the value of human motivations, human attention, and human work.

I will design and use systems that empower humans to direct and govern them.

I will not design, deploy, or use systems that degrade, dehumanise, or disorient others, nor will I participate in the propagation of illusions that erode our shared understanding of reality.

I will strive to make my work an instrument of peace, reconciliation, and ecological stewardship, taking responsibility for its impact on the social fabric and the natural world.

I will strive to ensure that my work offers protection for the vulnerable, and care for the marginalised; empowers human attention to what is good; and aligns with human orientations to noble motivations.

I will uphold the integrity of this oath, and when faced with a conflict between these commitments and the demands of my profession, I will give voice to my conscience.
