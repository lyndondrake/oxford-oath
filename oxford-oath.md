*Show by good conduct that your works come from the humility of wisdom.* (James 3:13)

## Open letter

We, the undersigned, offer our support for these statements:

We celebrate the ways AI aids understanding, improves well-being, democratises opportunity, enhances creativity, supports efficiency, and empowers humanity in our shared vocation to deepen understanding, advance human flourishing, and enrich culture.

We are conscious that our creativity is both a gift and a responsibility, and that the tools we form in turn form us, including our cognition and moral reasoning.

We believe in the dignity and worth of every natural human person. Technology ought to serve humanity and contribute to the common good, enhancing human freedom and protecting the vulnerable. The intelligence of artificial systems does not confer on them equality of moral worth with humans, much less divine-like status. While anthropomorphism can be useful, we should guard against misrepresenting artificial systems as if they were humans.

We observe that AI can offer pathways towards or away from knowledge of reality. We believe that design choices around data and algorithms involve implicit and explicit moral and ethical decisions, noting especially the issues of truthfulness and transparency.

We regret the ways AI has been used to erode attention, confuse understanding of reality, misuse data, displace dignified work, and contribute to new burdens in societies and the natural world.

We recognise that work on AI techniques, systems, and products requires the ongoing exercise of judgement for technical choices made amid uncertainty, with limited information and agency. It also requires judgement about how we present to others the choices we make, and the impact of those choices on the nature, imperfections, biases, influences, and limits of AI systems. Our judgements in these matters have consequences for humanity, and we commit to giving serious attention to the moral reasoning these judgements require.

When faced with a conflict between conscience and the demands of our profession, we will exercise wisdom in giving voice to conscience and acting in line with our agency.
