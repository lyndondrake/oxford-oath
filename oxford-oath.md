## Motto

Ostendat ex bona conversatione operationem suam in mansuetudine sapientiae. (James 3:11)

## Preamble

Believing in the sanctity of every human person, and that technology ought to serve us and contribute to the common good;

Conscious that our creativity is both a gift and a responsibility, and that the tools we form in turn form us;

Recognising that AI work requires the exercise of judgement for technical choices made with limited information and agency, and which have consequences for humans;

Lamenting the ways AI has already been used to erode attention, displace human connection, degrade the dignity of work, and inflict harm upon the natural world;

And yet, rejoicing in the potential of AI to aid understanding, improve wellbeing, democratise opportunity, and empower humanity in our shared vocation to seek the true, the good, and the beautiful;

## Commitments

In the presence of God (or: what I hold most sacred) and these witnesses, I make these commitments:

### Orientation

I will approach my work with humility, mindful of my limitations and the consequences of my actions.

I will honour the sanctity of humanity, neither attributing personhood to my work, nor elevating my work to divine status.

I will approach my work with joy and caution at the wonder and weight of what we are making.

### Vision

I will design, implement, and use systems that empower human governance.

I will align my work with noble human motivations and noble objects of attention.

I will develop my work to support the social fabric of humanity and safeguard the the natural world.

### Responsibility

I will embed honesty in my work about the nature, imperfections, and limits of AI systems.

I will strive to make my work an instrument of peace.

I will guard against illusions that erode understanding of reality, harmful assymetries of power, and the devaluation of good and creative forms of human work.

## Conclusion

I will uphold the integrity of this oath, and when faced with a conflict between these commitments and the demands of my profession, I will give voice to my conscience and act as I am able.

(Optional: May God who has given me the will to profess these commitments grant me also the grace to perform them.)
