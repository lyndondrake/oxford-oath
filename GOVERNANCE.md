# Governance

At present, this repository is controlled solely by Lyndon Drake.

Others are free to fork the repository as they wish, and in general the intent is to treat the project's governance in a similar way to many open source projects, where popularity of a fork makes alternative governance a possibility at any time.

Early in 2026, I will identify a small group of those who have most actively contributed to the project and who are similar to a maintainer in an open source project, in order to distribute control to a wider group.

We will also establish a mechanism for signing up to the Open Letter, and to professing the Oath and maintaining some formal membership of a fellowship as a consequence.
